# Knowing When You've Got a Problem

_This was originally developed as a conference talk for Nebraska.Code() on July 25, 2025._

## Description

Intuition and experience are 2 of an engineering manager’s best friends. Managers typically rely on their understanding and observations to identify problems and solutions. After all, most managers were promoted because of being good engineers, and engineers are natural problem solvers, right?

Understanding and observation is great when you can see everything that is happening, but what do you do when there’s too much happening to be aware of? What if your team is remote? What if your team is too big? What if you manage multiple teams with tech leads that have natural biases and blind spots?

HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?

When there’s too much to observe naturally, we turn to data. We will discuss different data that can identify what is worth investigating, and how we can identify false positives. Then we will cover 5 mini-case studies showing how that data identified problems that the manager couldn’t easily see.
